# MLE_Final_Portfolio_Codecademy
Final project for the Machine Learning/ Ai fundamentals path on Codecademy

## Topic: Prediction of grades
In this project, I wanted to investigate whether demographic factors influence grades in a portuguese school.

## Random Forest and Ridge Regression 
I made an ML Pipeline and compared the Ridge regression and Random Forest models. The random forest model performed better and explained 27% of the variance.
